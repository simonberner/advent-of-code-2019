## The advent 2019 full of small coding puzzles
> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language and way you like.

Find the challenge and all infos on the [Advent of Code site](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about).

This repo contains my solutions written in Java for the Advent Of Code 2019 challenge :christmas_tree:
Be aware that my solutions are by far not the best, most elegant, clean and lean (in the sense of having only a minimum amount of lines of code) ones.
Rather it was important to me to experiment and learn new things along the way as also take some detours from time to time.
